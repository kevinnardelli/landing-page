The first CSS Project of The Odin Project

For this project I want to use properties that I haven't used on previous lessons and get more practice with the flexbox layout (and improve my english, sorry about that).
I want to thanks all The Odin Project staff, collaborators and fellow students, I'm having a really good time learning web developer with all of you!
